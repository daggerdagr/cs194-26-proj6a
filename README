TO RUN SUPER SIMPLE EXAMPLES OF THIS PROJECT

    uncomment/comment any of the functions written in main.py

warping.py

    contains a lot of the warping logic, including:
        computeH()
            for finding the values inside of H

        warpTo()
            warps an image using correspondence points
            sourcePts: original points on the image
            targetPts: points to use to find the warping needed to transform the image

        and other helper methods

outputMake.py
    functions to create different blending of warps

utils.py
    just personal helper functions
